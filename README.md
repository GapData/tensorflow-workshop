Abstract
-----

This 1 hour workshop will introduce the TensorFlow library and related ecosystem. TensorFlow is an open-source library for Artificial Intelligence, in particular Deep Learning. We'll start by talking what TensorFlow does and why so many people are using it. By the end of the talk, you should be able to install it, write basic programs, and recognize common use cases. Weâ€™ll also briefly discuss related projects. A laptop would be useful but not required.
